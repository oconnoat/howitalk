#How I Prepare &amp; Deliver a Talk

* Giving talks is a big part of academia, and in industry, an increasing pressure to have impact of the social, sicentific and commercial types
* I've been 'asked' to give talks in a wide variety of contexts, for a wide number of purposes, and I thought I would show you the tools and workflow that I've settled on.
* Three key parts for the talk
    * How I prepare
    * What tools I use
    * How I deliver
* Preparation
    * Decide before you slide
    * Working out timing: 1min before slides
    * consider your audience -- who are they and what do they know
    * What should they care about from your talk?
    * What can they take away: knowledge, action?
    * Beginning, middle, end
* Tools
    * Git
    * html5/js/css/d3
    * twitter
* Delivery
    * Have a punchline
    * Have a plan -- this far in this time
    * Know what to cut
    * Questions: be prepared to say I don't know
    * Tell a story
